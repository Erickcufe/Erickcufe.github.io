### Publications

In the bachelor thesis participate as co-author of the article ["Protein complexes associated with β-catenin differentially influence the differentiation profile of neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcp.28502).

In preparation: **"Machine Learning Models to Predict Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Associated with Alzheimer’s disease and the Neurovascular Unit"**

I am currently developing software for the study of non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Alzheimer's disease.
