#### THE FUTURE OF INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE 2019

###### Scripps Research Translational Institute

I attended the annual Future of Genomic Medicine conference
"The Future of Individualized Medicine conference will thus incorporate perspectives from the emerging fields of digital medicine, artificial intelligence and machine learning, behavioral science and others. This is truly a multidisciplinary forum designed to accelerate the transformation of medicine."
